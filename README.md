# Approach taken and Technologies

# In my portfolio site I tried to make something like an interactive buisiness card, I have multiple Div containers set inside each other for a simple clean look with some shadowboxing. Each section of the webpage can be navigated through the button icons at the top. I added a bouncing animation to them so the page has a little life and isnt so static. A few of the buttons have a text change on hover, Projects one was done in jQuery with mouseover function and the other 2 (embedded pages in the projects menu) are done with a hover function in a <span>. Projects page has 2 interactive games to play, both have a wiggle effect and changes text on hover. Both interactive games will open in new tabs.
# Social Media links are done with icons donwloaded and then I styled them with a hover effect that greys out the icon as well as flashes through the colors that the company icon represents. FB is blue, Reddit is red, LinkedIn is blue and white, Instagram uses purple, red, yellow and magenta and google uses red, yellow, blue and green. All colors were meant to match company color scheme.
# Contact button opens a modal window with a MAILTO: form, its not what I would like to do but I wasnt sure if using prewritten forms for php contact was allowed.
# Resume and Projects pages are embedded within the center DIVs. I thought this may be best for easily updating my Resume or Projects page. Both arent fixed to this website and can be used for other purposes, like updating or emailing my resume or project pages by them selves.


# Unsolved or Future to do:

# 1) Id like to have the interactive games open in their own modal windows and not take you off the page.
# 2) Add a photo carosel to the About Me section
# 3) Set up a php contact form
# 4) Have scroll bars transparent, they dont show up on mobile but do in my browser window.
# 5) Chnage center DIV box to inline block instead of FLEX, it changes size slightly to make room for content, not visible on PC but can be seen on mobile.
