# Project-1_Portfolio_Site
Project 1 - portfolio site/app

You will be building a portfolio site for yourself.

# ðŸ”´ Mandatory To Pass:
# MVP - Minimum Viable Product
# Your application must meet these requirements:
# Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
# Hosted on Netlify or Github Pages.
# Commits to Github every day.
# A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
# The app must:
# Have the following pages:
# home (greeting page)
# bio (your background)
# resume (past work experience)
# projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build)
# links (links to your github, linkedin, and other sites you find interesting)
# optionally, instead of making this a separate page, you can make these links appear as part of a navigation section that appears on all pages
# Use JS/JQuery to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens). Write these from scratch. Please don't use 3rd party frameworks/libraries like jQuery UI, bootstrap, etc.
# Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).
# ðŸ”µ Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):
# Create a complex user interface module (e.g. a carousel, modal, sticky nav, etc)
# Create an additional browser-based game (e.g. a quiz, choose your own adventure, battle game, etc)
# Research AJAX (covered later in this course) and create an app that displays interesting data from an external source (ask your instructor for a list of good sources)
