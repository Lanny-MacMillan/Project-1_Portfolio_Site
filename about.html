                            <h5>Ive been working in the Electrical industry for 25 years. It started with an apprenticeship at a small company when I was 15 and that brought me to getting my electrical license 5 years later. With that license I became a project foreman/lead electrician running projects valued from $50k to $3 million with a crew of up to 15 people. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After a few years of successful project completions I was promoted to Project Manager overseeing the same projects I had been running. This was a good fit but I excelled at problem solving and troubleshooting electrical issues. This led me to start my own electrical service company, I really enjoyed the business side of it. I had my own company for a few years and we did so well that the company I left bought me out and had me run a service division within that company. We grew and expanded the division, hired more electricians and bought more service vehicles.

                            <br>
                            But over the years I lost alot of the passion and fun I had doing Electrical, so I started to revisit programming which I enjoyed alot in High School. Im currently at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program learning to be a software developer, looking forward to a new future.</h5>
